# Unity 2D Roguelike Prototype

This repository contains a **beginner-level 2D roguelike game prototype** developed with **Unity and C#** as a **small group learning project**.

The project was **initially based on a guided tutorial**, which our team intentionally chose to learn game development from an experienced source instead of attempting to design all systems from scratch.  
The goal was to understand how real-world Unity projects are structured and how gameplay systems interact.

After following the tutorial, the team **experimented with small changes, adjustments, and extensions** to better understand the mechanics and code flow.

## 🎮 Project Overview

The prototype explores core roguelike-style mechanics and a simple gameplay loop.

Features explored during the project:
- Player movement and health system
- Enemy movement, chasing, and attack behavior
- Basic combat and damage flow
- EXP pickups and level-up logic
- Upgrade selection system using ScriptableObjects
- Simple UI elements for health and upgrades

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Unity (2D)
- C#
- ScriptableObjects
- Basic UI (Canvas, Buttons, Text)
- Git for version control

## 📚 Learning Approach

As a team, we followed a **tutorial-first learning approach** in order to:
- Observe how an experienced developer structures a Unity project
- Understand common gameplay and code organization patterns
- Learn how different systems (player, enemies, progression, UI) interact

The focus was not on originality, but on **learning professional workflows and reading existing codebases**.

## ⚠️ Current State & Limitations

This project is intentionally **basic and not production-ready**:
- Enemy AI and balancing are minimal
- No advanced animations or effects
- No procedural generation or save system
